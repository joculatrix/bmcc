A work-in-progress to re-implement my [B-Minor Compiler](https://github.com/joculatrix/bminor) in Rust.
Ultimately, the backend will be done with LLVM via Inkwell, a model I practiced in a smaller example project
[here](https://github.com/joculatrix/foo_llvm).

I'm currently working on typechecking in my local branch.
